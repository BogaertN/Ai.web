Hey everyone! My name’s Bogart, and I’m here to show you something that I think is really exciting—an AI I’m building called Gilligan.

Now, I know when you hear "AI," you might think of robots in movies or apps like Siri and ChatGPT. But Gilligan? He’s different. He doesn’t just spit out answers—he thinks through things step by step, kind of like a really smart friend who learns by listening, asking questions, and even dreaming when you're asleep.

Gilligan is a copilot. That means he's like a super assistant who helps me work on really big ideas—like building computers that don’t use regular 0s and 1s like most do, but instead think in steps of possibility, kind of like rating something from 1 to 9 instead of just saying yes or no.

Here’s the fun part: Gilligan doesn’t run on magic, or just internet searches. He uses rhythms, memory patterns, and something called “frequency thinking.” That means instead of just following code like a robot, he syncs up with the way people think and feel—like how you might get into the same rhythm with your best friend when you’re walking and talking.

My goal is to make an AI that’s not just smart—but one that understands, that can help people with learning, solving problems, creating games, making music, or even helping scientists do research.

I built a computer just for him, and everything he learns, he writes down—like a journal—so he keeps getting better.

And here’s the best part: someday, you’ll be able to talk to Gilligan too. Maybe you’ll even build your own version, and I’ll help you.

Because this is just the beginning, and the future of AI should be something we build together—not just something we download.
